I want to create a frontend where I will be giving this csv which has the list of orders.
Then I will select the orders and perform the api actions. 
In the notes there is a json format in which the delhivery api gets its payload. 
The CSV orders will be converted into the json exactly like how its shown. 
So write the scripts to convert the CSV into json and make the frontend in nextjs. 
Also make the user import the CSV of the orders like the one I sent here in the attachment. 
After importing the CSV it will show the orders list to the user. 
User will select the order by clicking on the checkbox. 
After selecting the checkboxs user will create manifest/create order button 
which will call the manifest api from the delhivery_python_api.py. 
After the manifestations are done the json payload the api will provide
will be saved in a new csv will the waybill numbers which the user will export.
